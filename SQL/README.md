Welcome to data analysis with SQL! 

In this repository, you will discover two case studies that cover a wide range of SQL data analysis techniques, including database creation, data cleaning, database querying, and critical thinking. These projects showcase my ability to extract insights in a manner that is easily understandable for decision-makers.
