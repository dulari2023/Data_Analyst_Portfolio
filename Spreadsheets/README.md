Welcome to the world of data analytics with Spreadsheets! 

In this folder, you will find a project that showcases my proficiency in data analysis using Spreadsheets. Spreadsheets are powerful tools for managing, analyzing, and visualizing data, especially for small datasets.

In this repository, you will find my case study that illustrates the trends in cyclists' bike usage among annual members and casual riders. The dataset used for this analysis is a publicly available real dataset on cycling trips. You can access the Google Sheets links in the "Trip_data.pdf" file, which demonstrate how I analyzed cyclists' data for three consecutive months. The cleaned data for January, February, and March is presented in the first sheet of “Trip_Data_Jan,” “Trip_Data_Feb,” and “Trip_Data_Mar.” Columns for “Ride_length” and “day_of_week” have been calculated and are included in each sheet. Additionally, pivot tables for each month can be found in the “Pivot_Tables” sheets. Furthermore, I have merged the information from each month's pivot table into the “summary” sheet in “Trip_Data_Jan,” which is visualized using graphs.

I trust you will find this repository both informative and engaging. I am open to any discussions about my qualifications and experiences. Thank you for taking the time to explore my repository.
